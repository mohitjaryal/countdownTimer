# ⏳ Countdown Timer using Python

A simple **Countdown Timer** built in Python that displays the time in minutes and seconds — and even **speaks** when time is up (on macOS).  
This project is perfect for beginners learning about loops, time handling, and basic automation with Python.

## 🧩 How It Works
1. The user enters time (in seconds).  
2. The program counts down using a `while` loop and updates the display every second.  
3. When the timer hits zero, your Mac says:  
   > “Hello sir, time is up.”  
4. The program also prints a bell sound (`\a`) for a terminal beep.
